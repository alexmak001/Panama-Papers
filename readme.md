Using Neoj4 and Python, we are diving into the shady financial dealings of the top 1%.

Panama Papers and Paradise Papers are leaked documents that expose personal financial information of wealthy individuals and political leaders that take place in offshore companies. With hundreds of thousands of entities involved in these leaks, it becomes tedious for investigators to pick out the companies worth investigating. We propose a solution with our project that is to be able to predict what entities are likely involved in illegal activity. This abstracts the investigator from sifting through thousands of data points and closing the scope to the ones that matter. Our research utilizes XGBoost and feature extraction to find suspicious entities within our dataset.
